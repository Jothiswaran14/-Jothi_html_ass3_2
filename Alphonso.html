    <p><strong>Devgad is a popular coastal village in Sindhudurg district of the state of Maharashtra and located on the 
        Arabian Sea in the coastal Konkan region. This village is renowned for its beach, harbor and a lighthouse 
        constructed in the year 1915 at the Deogad fort. Being a coastal place, the staple diet of people is rice 
        and fish. However, Devgad is majorly known for its unadulterated Alphonso mango cultivation. Alphonso is 
        one of the most expensive as well as finest varieties of mangoes. The mangoes are grown mainly in the
         western part of India including Sindhudurg, Raigad and Ratnagiri districts. Alphonsoes are often 
         referred to as ‘Hapus’ in Maharashtra and Gujarat states. Also, they are used to make sweets, 
         smoothies, candies and mango drinks. The mango can also be consumed directly after ripe and a favorite
        fruit in India during summers.</strong></p> <br><br>
