    <p><strong>There are very few towns in the state of Gujarat which offer the diversity similar to that 
        Junagadh offers to its visitors. Much of the attractions of this town has been ruined through the 
        time but there is several well-maintained by the government and is open for public as well as 
        tourists to see. The best thing to know is that Junagadh is the place where ‘the Queen of Mangoes, 
        Kesar’, is cultivated and distributed throughout the country.</strong></p>
